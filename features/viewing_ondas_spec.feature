Feature: viewing ondas
  In order to find new music
  As a user of QueOnda
  I want to see Ondas (links to music btw)

  Scenario: QueOnda homepage shows Ondas
    Given I am on the index page
    And I am logged in
    When I make an Onda

    Given Sally creates an Onda
    And I am on the index page
    Then I should see "Sally"

    And I am on the index page
